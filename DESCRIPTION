Description: Gradient boosted and LD adjusted (GraBLD) alogorithm produces boosted and LD corrected polygenic gene scores that can be applied to polygenic traits prediction. The gradient boosted regression tree model is first used to optimize the weights of SNPs included in the polygenic scores by leveraging the large number of variants in genome-wide studies and the availability of summary association test statistics from meta-analyses. The linkage disequilibrium between SNPs is then adjusted locally in a user-defined regional.
